## Key_Feutures_Implemented:

The most important key feature i coded in the website is **accessing request data** which i used for the contact [form.](http://form.It)When submit is clicked all of the three data are saved in a csv and not in any known database as Mongdb etc,as i wanted to practice my **write to csv** skills.Another important feature is the server-side errors **error-handling**,as it is the most vital part in every project and is what makes the difference.Lastly, the website got **tested and patched for known vulnarabilities** so my website is safe and secure.
